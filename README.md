OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT :

Project: QUIZ GAME
Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a simple quiz game that presents multiple choice questions to the user. The game should keep track of the userâ€™s score and provide feedback based on their answers.
Features:

Question Structure:Each question is presented with four options, and the user must select one by entering the corresponding number.
The questions are stored in a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains:
Question Text: The question being asked.
Options: A list of four possible answers.
Correct Answer: The correct answer for that question.
Game Flow:The game loops through the list of questions, displaying each question with its multiple-choice options.
The user is prompted to choose an answer by entering the number corresponding to the option.
After each input, the game provides feedback:
Correct Answer: If the user selects the correct option.
Incorrect Answer: If the selected answer is wrong, the correct answer is displayed.
Score Tracking:The user's score is incremented each time they answer a question correctly.
At the end of the quiz, the total score is shown, providing feedback on how well the user did.
Input Validation:The game handles invalid inputs (such as non-numeric responses or numbers outside the available options) by providing an error message and prompting the user to enter a valid answer.
Final Score Display:After all the questions are answered, the game displays the final score, showing the number of correct answers out of the total number of questions.
